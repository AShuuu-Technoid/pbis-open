/*
 * The purpose of this module is to communicate with a Password Safe server
 * to pull down credentials for a user. Refer to the Pasword Safe API User
 * Guide. The steps used for retrieving a password are:
 *
 * 0) Retrieve configuration information from a file
 * 1) POST <base>/Auth/SignAppin
 * 2) GET<base>/ManagedAccounts
 * 3) POST <base>/Requests
 * 4) GET <base>/Credentials/{requestId}
 * 5) PUT <base>/Requests/{requestId}/Checkin
 * 6) POST <base>/Auth/Signout
 *
 * Step 3) returns a requestId which is used in steps 4) and 5).
 *
 * For each of the steps, the corresponding functions below are:
 *
 * 0) PbpsApiGetConfig()
 * 1) PbpsApiSignIn()
 * 2) PbpsApiManagedAccountsGet()
 * 3) PbpsApiRequestId()
 * 4) PbpsApiCredentialsGet()
 * 5) PbpsApiRequestCheckin()
 * 6) PbpsApiSignOut()
 *
 * Functions 0 to 6 should not be called directly from outside the djpbps/
 * directory.
 *
 * Instead PbpsApiGetCredentials() is a wrapper around steps 0 to 6 and as such
 * should be invoked at domainjoin join and leave.
