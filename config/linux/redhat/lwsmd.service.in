# We want systemd to give lwsmd some time to finish gracefully, but still want
# it to kill lwsmd after TimeoutStopSec if something went wrong during the
# graceful stop. Normally, Systemd sends SIGTERM signal right after the
# ExecStop, which would kill lwsmd. We are sending useless SIGCONT here to give
# lwsmd time to finish.
