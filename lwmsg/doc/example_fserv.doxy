/**
@page example_fserv Tutorial

@section Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to use <tt>LWMsg</tt> to implement a
file server daemon and client API that supports open, read, write, and close
operations.  Although a file server that only accepts clients over local
IPC has limited use in the real world, it provides good coverage of most
of <tt>LWMsg</tt>'s features:

- Type specification
- Authentication using security tokens
- Opaque handles
- Implementing a multi-threaded server
- Implementing a multi-threaded client API

This example is available in the <tt>LWMsg</tt> source distribution in the
<tt>example/fserv</tt> subdirectory where it can be built and run.
