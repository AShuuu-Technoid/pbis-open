/**
 * @brief Generic buffer
 *
 * This structure comprises a generic buffer used as
 * as a source or destination for data streams when performing
 * various operations such as marshalling, printing, etc.  It
 * contains pointers which delimit the start, end, and current
 * position within a contiguous block of memory.  It also
 * contains an optional wrap callback function which is invoked when
 * the cursor reaches the end of the buffer.  This function may
 * reset, refill, or resize the buffer so that the operation
 * can continue.

    /**
     * @brief Buffer wrap callback
     * 
     * This optional callback is invoked when the end of the buffer is
     * reached.  It may arbitrarily modify the base, end, and cursor
     * pointers, so long as the condition (end - cursor) >= 1 holds --
     * that is, there must be at least one unused or unread byte in the
     * buffer.
     *
     * The needed parameter specifies the number of bytes the marshaller
     * is immediately attempting to read or write, but it is merely a
     * suggestion.  In the interest of amortizing calls to this function,
     * it is better to make the usable portion of the buffer (end - cursor)
     * a large as possible on each call.  It is safe to return with
     * (end - cursor) < needed, but this is not recommended.
     *
     * A needed value of 0 indicates that the operation in question
     * (e.g. #lwmsg_data_marshal()) is complete, and is an opportunity
     * to perform any final cleanup (e.g. flushing the partially filled
     * buffer to the underlying data stream).
