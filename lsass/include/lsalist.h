 *
 *     Embedded Linked Lists API
 *
 * @details
 *
 *     This API lets you manipulate embedded linked lists.  These
 *     at linked lists where the links are stored inside the object,
 *     thus allowing efficient (and simple) manipulation of lists
 *     containing the object.  (For example, you can remove an object
 *     from a list only by using a reference to the object since the
 *     object conains the list pointers and w/o doing any searching.
 *     Another example is that you never need to allocate extra
 *     memory when adding an element to a list.)
