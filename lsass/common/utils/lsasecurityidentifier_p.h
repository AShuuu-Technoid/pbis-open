//S-<revision>-<authority>-<domain_computer_id>-<relative ID>
//example: S-1-5-32-546 (Guests)
//See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330

//In binary format, 
//the fields are encoded as unsigned integers of varying lenths and endianness:
//<revision>: 1-byte, big-endian
//<word count>: 1-byte, big-endian
//<authority>: a 6-byte, big-endian number containing the number of subsequent 4-byte, little endian, unsigned integers
//<domain_computer_id>: a sequence of 4-byte, little-endian unsigned integers
//<relative-id>: 4-byte, little-endian, unsigned integer


//So for example, if your SID is S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-72713, 
//then your raw hex SID is
// 01 05 000000000005 15000000 A065CF7E 784B9B5F E77C8770 091C0100
//This breaks down as follows:
// 01   S-1
// 05   (seven dashes, seven minus two = 5)
// 000000000005 (5 = 0x000000000005, written as big-endian) 6 bytes
// 15000000 (21 = 0x00000015, written as big-endian)  4 bytes
// A065CF7E (2127521184 = 0x7ECF65A0, written as big-endian)  4 bytes
// 784B9B5F (1604012920 = 0x5F9B4B78, written as big-endian)  4 bytes
// E77C8770 (1887927527 = 0X70877CE7, written as big-endian)  4 bytes
// 091C0100 (72713 = 0x00011c09, written as big-endian)

//This will calculate a hash of the last three RID's (if they exist) and the low 19
//bits of the RID
