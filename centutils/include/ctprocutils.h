/* Find the pid(s) of processes whose executable machines programName. The program name does not include the path. Processes whose root directory does not match the current root directory are not returned. The caller should set count to the size of pid buffer. This function will set pid to the number of matching processes.
 *
 * If more programs match than there is space for in the buffer, as many processes as possible will be filled in. count will be set to how many processes matched, not how many were stored.
 *
 * If count is NULL, then it is assumed that the pid buffer has space for exactly 1 pid. In this case, if at least one pid is found, the first one is stored in the buffer. If no matching pids are found, DWORD_NO_SUCH_PROCESS is returned. When count is not NULL, it is not considered an error when no processes match.
 *
 * pid may be NULL. This is only useful when count is also NULL, in which case the error code can be used to determine whether a process is running or not without actually finding the pid.
 *
 * (uid_t)-1 is treated as wildcard for the owner parameter, and all uids will be matched in this case.
 *
 * Please check the implementation of this function before using it. It may not be implemented for your platform. In this case, it will return DWORD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
